This is a simple intranet web application to schedule surgeries based on my own needs that may be useful for your hospital too.

This standalone application is built with Python3.8 with standard libraries and sqlite3, which is extracted from my another project [Pyserve](https://github.com/gouliming4437/PyServe). You can make necessary changes to fit your needs.

## Features
